Crowd Level Detection System using Mask R-CNN.
Project Description 
This project aims to develop a crowd level detection system using Mask R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) approach. Mask R-CNN is a method in the field of computer vision that is able to detect and identify objects, and provide pixel segmentation based on the type of object.

Key Features
Crowd Level Object Detection: Able to identify and mark human objects in an image or video to measure the crowdedness of an area.

Object Pixel Segmentation: Provides detailed pixel segmentation for each detected human object, enabling deeper analysis of visitor patterns and behavior.

Simple User Interface: Comes with an intuitive user interface for easy usage and visual understanding of detection results.

Instructions for Use

1. Model Configuration: Customize the model configuration and other parameters in the config.yaml file according to the needs of the project or environment.

2. Run the Application: Execute the program by running the demo.py command. Make sure to grant the necessary access rights if required.

3. Analyze Results: Once the detection is complete, the results will be available through the user interface or can be exported for further analysis.
